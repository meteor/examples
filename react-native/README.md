This is a sample app that shows how to use Meteor React Native to build native apps.

It is based on the Meteor Simple Todos React tutorial (https://github.com/meteor/react-tutorial). It contains the same features.

The code has been copied directly from the Web Version of the tutorial, and modified as little as possible. Almost all of the logical code has remained the same, only the UI code has been changed.

This sample app connects to the server at http://react-tutorial.meteorapp.com/. Both the Web Example app and this native counterpart do not provide a way to create accounts, so it is recommended that you use your browser console to create an account, then use that to login.

## To Use
1. Follow the instructions for setting up your dev environment: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `npm install` inside the repository
4. (If running on iOS) cd into `ios/` and run `pod install`
5. Use `npx react-native` to run the app, e.g. `npx react-native run-ios` or `npx react-native run-android`
